# Linked Data DIDOK README [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lindas-uc/ld-didok.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lindas-uc/ld-didok)

This DIDOK Linked Data export is based on the Excel file found in `input`.

It gets build by [RML-Mapper](https://github.com/zazukoians/RML-Mapper/).

## RDF Export

This is a first PoC version of an LD-Export. It will hopefully be gradually expanded in the next months. So far only few triples are attached to the station and the namespace is not fixed yet.

The Linked Data version provides a pretty simple mapping of the DIDOK tables. We do not include the name of the community but instead link to the URI of the appropriate municipality in the "Historisiertes Gemeindeverzeichnis", maintained by "Bundesamt f√ºr Statistik".

The x/y values are LV03 x/y coordinates. If you want to get WGS84  lat/long values instead you might want to use the [Swisstopo API](http://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/internet/swisstopo/en/home/products/software/products/m2m/lv03towgs84.html). In a final Linked Data version this should surely be included by default.
