# Linked Data DIDOK README [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lindas-uc/ld-didok.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lindas-uc/ld-didok)

This DIDOK Linked Data export is based on the CSV file found in `input`.

It gets build by [RML-Mapper](https://github.com/zazukoians/RML-Mapper/).

## Source

The data is taken from the [SBB Open Data Portal](https://data.sbb.ch/), more specifically from the [DIDOK](https://data.sbb.ch/explore/dataset/didok-liste/information/) list. You can get the CSV directly from [this link](https://data.sbb.ch/explore/dataset/didok-liste/download/?format=csv&timezone=Europe/Berlin&use_labels_for_header=true).

## RDF Export

This is a first PoC version of an LD-Export. It will hopefully be gradually expanded in the next months. So far only few triples are attached to the station and the namespace is not fixed yet.

The Linked Data version provides a pretty simple mapping of the DIDOK tables. We do not include the name of the community but instead link to the URI of the appropriate municipality in the "Historisiertes Gemeindeverzeichnis", maintained by "Bundesamt f√ºr Statistik".

## Accessing the data online

Each URI used can be directly dereferenced by HTTP, for example this entry for [SBB Cargo](http://lod.opentransportdata.swiss/didok/8500011). You can request different RDF serializations for each resource, like Turtle, JSON-LD, RDF/XML etc.

If you want to query the data you can use the LINDAS SPARQL endpoint at [lindas-data.ch/sparql](http://lindas-data.ch/sparql). You can find the data in the graph `http://lindas-data.ch/resource/ld-didok`. See this [YASGUI query](http://lod.opentransportdata.swiss/sparql/#query=PREFIX+rdf%3A+%3Chttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F1999%2F02%2F22-rdf-syntax-ns%23%3E%0APREFIX+rdfs%3A+%3Chttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2F01%2Frdf-schema%23%3E%0ASELECT+*+WHERE+%7B+GRAPH+%3Chttps%3A%2F%2Flinked.opendata.swiss%2Fgraph%2FFOT%2Fdidok%3E+%7B%0A++%3Fsub+%3Fpred+%3Fobj+.%0A++%7D%0A%7D%0ALIMIT+10&contentTypeConstruct=text%2Fturtle&contentTypeSelect=application%2Fsparql-results%2Bjson&endpoint=http%3A%2F%2Flindas-data.ch%2Fsparql&requestMethod=POST&tabTitle=Query&headers=%7B%7D&outputFormat=table) as an example.
